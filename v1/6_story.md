# Stallabella's Story

![Stallabella](images/image_0.png)

Once upon a time, in a cozy little town, there lived a 7-year-old girl named Stallabella. She had the most beautiful blond curly hair and sparkling blue eyes. Stallabella was known for her kindness and her funny jokes that made everyone laugh. But Stallabella had one serious problem: she stalled all the time.

Every morning, her mom would gently shake her awake, "Stallabella, it's time to get up!" But Stallabella would roll over and say, "Just five more minutes, please!" She would stretch and yawn, making waking up look like a slow-motion ballet dance.

When it was time to get dressed, Stallabella would twirl around her room, trying on different outfits, as if she were on a stage in a drama class. "Hurry up, Stallabella!" her dad would call. But she would just giggle and say, "I'm almost ready!"

Breakfast was no different. Stallabella would take tiny bites of her cereal, pretending she was a princess at a royal feast. "We need to leave for school, Stallabella!" her parents would remind her. But she would smile and say, "Just one more bite!"

Stallabella's stalling continued throughout the day. She would dawdle on her way to school, stopping to admire every flower and chat with every squirrel. Her teachers and friends would often have to wait for her, but Stallabella didn't mind. To her, stalling was an art, a performance that she enjoyed.

One sunny morning, Stallabella's teacher announced a very special event. "Tomorrow, we will have a surprise guest at school! It's someone very important, and you won't want to miss it!"

Stallabella was excited, but the next morning, she fell into her usual routine. She stalled getting out of bed, stalled getting dressed, and stalled eating breakfast. By the time she was ready to leave, she was very late.

When Stallabella finally arrived at school, she saw her friends gathered around someone special. It was a famous author who had come to read a new story and sign books for the children. Stallabella's heart sank. She had missed the entire event because of her stalling.

That evening, Stallabella sat on her bed, feeling sad. She realized that her stalling had caused her to miss something very important. She thought about how her stalling was like a performance, but sometimes, performances had to end so that other important things could happen.

The next morning, Stallabella woke up with a new determination. She got out of bed right away, dressed quickly, and ate her breakfast without stalling. Her parents were surprised and happy to see her ready on time.

"I've learned my lesson," Stallabella said with a smile. "From now on, I'll try to hurry up and get things done when it's important."

To celebrate her new attitude, Stallabella decided to pick a new name for herself. She thought long and hard and finally chose the name "Swiftabella," because she wanted to be swift and timely.

From that day on, Swiftabella still enjoyed her moments of fun and creativity, but she also knew when it was time to hurry up and get things done. And she never missed another important event again.

And so, Swiftabella lived happily ever after, balancing her love for performance with the importance of being timely. The end.
