Story:

Stallabella is a 7-year-old girl with blond curly hair and blue eyes. She is kind-hearted and funny, but she has a peculiar habit of stalling. From getting out of bed to getting dressed, eating breakfast, and arriving at school, Stallabella finds ways to delay everything. Her parents constantly urge her to hurry, but she treats stalling like a performance, akin to a ballet dance or drama class.

One day, her stalling causes her to miss a significant event at school. This experience teaches her that while stalling can be fun, it isn't always practical. Realizing the importance of timely actions, Stallabella decides to change her ways and adopts a new name that reflects her newfound attitude.
